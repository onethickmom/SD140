                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Summary</b>: Halo 3 is a shooter game where players primarily experience gameplay from a first-person perspective. Much of the
                            gameplay takes place on foot, but also includes segments focused on vehicular combat. Gameplay focuses on the "Golden
                            Triangle of Halo": players utilize weapons, grenades, and melee attacks, which are available to a player in most
                            situations. Players may dual-wield some weapons for additional firepower, forgoing the use of grenades and melee
                            attacks. Unlike previous installments, the player's secondary weapon is visible on their player model, holstered or
                            slung across the player's back. Halo 3 introduces support weapons, cumbersome two-handed weapons that slow the player
                            when carried, but offer greatly increased firepower in return.</li>
                            <li><b>Notable Mentions:</b> First-day sales of Halo 3 reached $170 million in the U.S., setting a record for highest gross of a video game within 24
                            hours of its release in 2007.</li>

                            <li><b>Summary</b>: The player controls Ethan Winters from a first-person perspective as he searches a derelict estate for his missing wife.
                            Although Ethan is a civilian with few combat skills, he is able to arm himself with a variety of weapons including
                            handguns, shotguns, flamethrowers, explosives and chainsaws against the estate's residents, the Baker family, as well as
                            humanoid fungal creatures known as the "Molded" and mutated insects. He can block attacks to reduce damage. Various
                            sections of the game are spent being pursued by members of the Baker family, who, if engaged in combat, can only be
                            temporarily incapacitated. However, these encounters are avoidable by means of stealth, or running away.</li>

                        <li>Oregon Trail - Rating: 10 / 10</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Summary</b>: The Oregon Trail is a series of educational computer games. The first game was originally developed by Don Rawitsch,
                            Bill Heinemann, and Paul Dillenberger in 1971 and produced by the Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium (MECC) in
                            1974. The original game was designed to teach 8th grade schoolchildren about the realities of 19th-century pioneer life
                            on the Oregon Trail. The player assumes the role of a wagon leader guiding a party of settlers from Independence,
                            Missouri, to Oregon's Willamette Valley via a covered wagon in 1848.</li>
                            <li><b>Notable Mentions:</b> There are many versions of this game, but the concept remains the same for each. Fantastic game.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Nancy Drew (Series) - Rating: 10 / 10</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Summary</b>: Nancy Drew is a fictional character appearing in several mystery book series, movies, games, and a TV show as a teenage amateur
                            sleuth. There are 33 Nancy Drew games that involve various problems that Nancy investigates. The first game, <i>Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill</i>, was released in 1998.</li>
                            <li><b>Notable Mentions:</b> Not sure what it is about this, but these were far more fun than any Sherlock Holmes games that were made.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>RollerCoaster Tycoon (1999) - Rating: 10 / 10</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Summary</b>: The premise of the game is to complete a series of preset scenarios by successfully building and maintaining amusement
                            parks through business ownership as a theme park entrepreneur. Players can choose from dozens of roller coaster types
                            and can also build log flumes, carousels, bumper cars, haunted houses, go-karts, Ferris wheels, and swinging ships,
                            among other rides. The player may hire handymen to sweep paths, empty garbage cans, water flowers and mow lawns;
                            mechanics to inspect and fix rides; security guards to prevent vandalism within the park; and entertainers to entertain
                            the guests. The geography and landscaping of the park can be modified, allowing the player to lower/raise terrain and
                            add water to improve the park's attractiveness, as well as to allow rides to fit into their surroundings more easily.
                            Players must also balance the needs of the visitors by strategically placing food stalls, concession stands, bathrooms,
                            and information kiosks.</li>
